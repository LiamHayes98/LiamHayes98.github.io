   <p>I have been a passionate UNC basketball fan since day one.  UNC basketball was my favorite thing growing up, and I attended Roy Williams basketball camp every summer I was eligible.  I was never very good at basketball, but I loved getting the player's autographs.  In 2008, I got every single autograph of the soon to be national championship team on a basketball and it is one of my most prized possessions.</p>

   <p>I have two awesome dogs that are morkies, which are a mix between a maltese and a yorkie.  The dog on the left is named Libby and she is only three years old.  The dog on the right is Rollie and he is 11 years old.  My family has always been dog people and we have fostered multiple dogs in the past.  We used to have basset hounds which are by far the chillest dogs to exist.</p>

   <p>One of my greatest achievements was earning the rank of Eagle Scout in my Boy Scout troop.  It was a seven year commitment and it required a lot of hard work and dedication.  Boy Scouts is definitely the activity that has had the biggest impact on my life in terms of my friends, my skills, my real world preparation, and my memories.</p>

   <p>I live on Lake Norman and when the weather is nice you can usually find me on the lake. I love to ski, wake board, and tube.  For my fisrt few summers in college I worked as a camp counselor for Davidson College Lake Camp.  Here I taught kids how to do water sports, sail, kayak, and canoe.  My family recently got a jet ski, which made this past summer extra entertaining.</p>
