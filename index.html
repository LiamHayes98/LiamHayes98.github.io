    <h>Week 1 Reflection</h>
<p>After the first class, I am happy to say that I am even more excited about taking this class.  In my discussions with other students, it seems that they have similar, as well as unique, interests that really helped me gauge what level I am at for my class and what I want to get out of this class.  My main take away from class was exposing my self to the principles of design.  The book did a great job at giving me examples that made sense and were easily relatable.  Although some of them seemed obvious, including talking about how to make sure the use of design is easy to understand regardless of the user's experience or knowledge, these are the fundamentals that I feel like may be overlooked more often than not.  This class was a great introduction, and the other readings gave me a good overview of what kind of mindest I need to be in throughout this course. </p>
